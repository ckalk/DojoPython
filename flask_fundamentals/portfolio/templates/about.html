<p>I am learning to be a web developer. I'm looking forward to using these new skills to help some small charities that can't afford to hire web developer(s). I think coding is a lot of fun. I haven't been hands-on, building applications from scratch, since my first career as a Fortran programmer. However, I've worked with web developers for the last 20 years, so I've heard the terminology and an somewhat familiar with the concepts.</p>
